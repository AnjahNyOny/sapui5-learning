# Step X : Title
_ Date : 15 September 13:30
_ Goal : Create an input field, as the user types, the description will be updated
_ What I did : 
            _ defined a new module
            _ added the onInit function which is invoked by the framework when the controller is created
            _ instantiated a JSON model, 

_ What I learned : 
            _ the data for the model only contains a siingle property for the "recipient", inside, it contains one additional property for the name
            _ binding the value to a sapui5 model by using the declarative binding for xml views
            _ the curlu brackets {...} indicates indicate that data is taken from the value of the recipient's name property, that is DATA BINDING
