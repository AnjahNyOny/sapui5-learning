# Step 4 : Xml views
_ Date : 16 September 12:05
_ Goal : Diplay text using sapui5 control
_ What I did : 
            _ Created the view folder : webapp/view/
            _ Created a view, and added a declarative definition of the text control with the same properties as the previous step
            _ Modified index.js, Using the control XMLView instead of Text

_ What I learned : 
                _ a view starts with a capitalized letter and ends with .view.xml
                _ default xml namespace is sap.m
