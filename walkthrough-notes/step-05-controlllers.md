# Step 5 : Controllers
_ Date : 16 September 12:35
_ Goal : Replace the text with a button, and when clicked, shows the text
_ What I did : 
            _ Created the controller folder, then the file App.controller.js
            _ Created a function onShowText that shows un alert
            _ Referenced the controller of the view
            _ Created a button in the view, that when pressed called the function onShowText in the controller

_ What I learned : 
            _ Controller names are capitalized, and. ends with .controller.js
            _ Controllers carry the same name as the related view
            _ Event handlers are prefixed with "on"
